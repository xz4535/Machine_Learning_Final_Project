Proposal
## 1. What questions are you answering?
This study seeks to address several key questions related to the application and effectiveness of Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNN) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) models in predicting stock market trends:
• How do CNN and RL models compare in their ability to predict stock market trends?
• Can these advanced deep learning and reinforcement learning models significantly outperform traditional forecasting
methods in stock market predictions?
• How do different configurations and fine-tuning strategies impact the performance of CNN and RL models on stock
market data?
## 2. Why is that question important?
Understanding the comparative strengths and weaknesses of CNN and RL models in stock market prediction is crucial
for developing more accurate and reliable forecasting tools. Improved prediction accuracy is vital for investors seeking
to make informed decisions, for economists interested in understanding market dynamics, and for advancing the
application of machine learning technologies in the financial sector.
## 3. What has been done already?
Previous research has explored the use of various machine learning models, including CNN and RL, for financial
market predictions. While studies have shown promise in using these models for forecasting, there is a need for a more
detailed comparative analysis, especially regarding the impact of model configurations and fine-tuning strategies on
their predictive performance in the stock market context.
## 4. What datasets will you use if any?
We will utilize comprehensive datasets comprising historical stock price index. These datasets will be sourced from
reputable financial data providers and public datasets, encompassing a broad spectrum of market conditions and stock
behaviors to ensure a thorough evaluation of the models’ performance.
## 5. How will you evaluate?
The evaluation of CNN and RL models will be conducted through:
• Performance Metrics: We will employ Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and
directional accuracy to quantify the models’ prediction performance.
• Comparative Analysis: A direct performance comparison between CNN and RL models will be made to assess
their respective predictive capabilities.
• Robustness and Generalization: The models will be tested under various market conditions to evaluate their
robustness and ability to generalize across different stocks and time periods.
